# Demonstrating Benford's law

This small Kotlin program shows that random numbers with an equally distributed exponent 
(related to the exponential representation) follow Benford's law; 
see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law)

An exemplary result of an execution with one million test numbers:

1st digit | frequency
----------|----------
1 | 0.301007
2 | 0.175633
3 | 0.12525
4 | 0.096895
5 | 0.079274
6 | 0.066767
7 | 0.058113
8 | 0.05118
